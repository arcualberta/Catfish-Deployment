One caller identified herself as a young Indigenous woman and requested an intersectional lens on the findings. If I remember correctly, she described herself as a mother and foster parent to a disabled child. She found the recommended 150 minutes of weekly physical exercise to reduce pregnancy risks out of reach for her and others due to gender-based responsibilities for childrearing, little to no respite while raising a disabled kid, limited disposable income for a gym membership, and inadequate access to public transit.

While some scholars have been rightly sceptical about the mainstreaming of intersectionality, there is also a great cost to not mainstreaming intersectional-type gender research across the Faculties. <br><br> As a signature area we promote an understanding that nearly all research needs to be intersectional to be successful. Thus we embrace the promise of mainstreaming intersectionality across diverse Faculties and disciplines, whilst remaining alert to the challenges of doing so </div></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4 director-image-block"><img src="'+u+'" class="director-image"></div><div class="col-md-8"><div class="director-name">Susanne Luhmann</div><div class="director-title">Director, Intersections of Gender</div></div></div><div class="director-content"> Dr. Susanne Luhmann is Director of Intersections of Gender, as well as an Associate Professor and former Chair in the Department of Women\u2019s and Gender Studies.
